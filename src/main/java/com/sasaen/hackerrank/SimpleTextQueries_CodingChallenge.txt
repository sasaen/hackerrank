Simple Text Queries

Given an array of n strings, sentences, where each sentencesi consists of at most w space-separated words, we want to perform q queries given by an array of q strings named queries where each queriesj consists of at most k space-separated words. To answer query queriesj, we find all the indices in sentences that contain every word in queriesj and assemble them into an array of indices listed in ascending order. For example, if all the words in queriesj are only found in sentences4, sentences9, and sentences2, then the answer to queriesj is the array [2, 4, 9].

Complete the textQueries function in the editor below. It has two parameters:
Name 	Type 	Description
sentences 	string array 	Each sentencesi (where 0 ≤ i < n) consists of at most w space-separated words.
queries 	string array 	Each queriesj (where 0 ≤ j < q) consists of at most k space-separated words.

Print q rows of output where each row index j contains the answer to queriesj in the form of an array of indices in ascending order; if no sentence in sentences contains all the words in queriesj, then the answer to that query is the array [-1] instead.

Input Format

    The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of strings in sentences.
    Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains at most w space-separated words describing sentencesi.
    The next line contains an integer, q, denoting the number of strings in queries.
    Each line j of the q subsequent lines contains at most k space-separated words describing queriesj.

Constraints

    1 ≤ n ≤ 104
    1 ≤ q ≤ 104
    1 ≤ w, k ≤ 10
    Each word has at most 11 characters.
    No word appears in more than 10 sentences.
    Each word consists of uppercase and lowercase English alphabetic letters only (i.e., the character class [a-zA-Z]).

Output Format

Print q rows of output where each row index j contains the answer to queriesj in the form of an array of indices in ascending order; if no sentence in sentences contains all the words in queriesj, then the answer to that query is the array [-1] instead.
Sample Case 0

Sample Input

3
jim likes mary
kate likes tom
tom does not like jim
2
jim tom
likes

Sample Output

2
0 1

Explanation

We perform the following q = 2 queries on sentences = ["jim likes mary", "kate likes tom", "tom does not like jim"]:

    Find the indices of sentences containing both the words "jim" and "tom". The only sentence containing both words is located at index 2, so the array [2] is stored in index 0 of the answer array.
    Find the indices of sentences containing the word "likes". This word appears in sentences0 and sentences1, so the array [0, 1] is stored in index 1 of the answer array.

We then print the array [[2], [0, 1]] as our answer.
Sample Case 1
Sample Case 2

Sample Input

3
it go will away
go do art
what to will east
3
it will
go east will
will

Sample Output

0
-1
0 2

Explanation

We perform the following q = 3 queries on sentences = ["it go will away", "go do art", "what to will east"]:

    Find the indices of sentences containing both the words "it" and "will". These words only appear in sentences0, so the array [0] is stored in index 0 of the answer array.
    Find the indices of sentences containing the words "go", "east", and "will". These words do not appear in any sentence, so the array [-1] is stored in index 1 of the answer array.
    Find the indices of sentences containing the word "will". This word appears in sentences0 and sentences2, so the array [0, 2] is stored in index 2 of the answer array.

We then print [[0], [-1], [0, 2]] as our answer.
