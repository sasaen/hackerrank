Consecutive Sum

Given a long integer, num, find the number of ways to represent it as a sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. For example:

 

    If num = 15, then there are three such ways: (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) = (4 + 5 + 6) = (7 + 8) = 15.
    If num = 2, then there are zero such ways.

 

Complete the consecutive function in the editor below. It has one parameter: a long integer named num. The function must return an integer denoting the number of ways to represent num as a sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

 

Input Format

Locked stub code in the editor reads a long integer denoting num from stdin and passes it to the function.

 

Constraints

    1 ≤ num ≤ 1012

 

Output Format

Return an integer denoting the number of ways to represent num as a sum of two or more consecutive positive integers.

 

Sample Input 0

15

 

Sample Output 0

3

 

Explanation 0

There are three ways to calculate num = 15 as a sum of two or more consecutive integers:

 

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
    4 + 5 + 6 = 15
    7 + 8 =15

 

Thus, the function returns 3.

 

Sample Input 1

10

 

Sample Output 1

1

 

Explanation 1

There is one way to calculate num = 10 as a sum of two or more consecutive integers:

 

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 =10

 

Thus, the function returns 1.
